# GitIgnore Summoner

Forget about installing VSCode extensions for this, forget install 64 packages for this, use this simple & minimal Python package that uses 2 packages (1 built-in, 1 external).

## Summoner Guide
Use your Linux `chmod` command to convert the main.py file to an executable or run the file in `./bin/`.
Next run the file but including the file name as an argument. It **must** match the file inside of the official `github/gitignore` repository.

```
$ ./src/main.py Clojure
```
